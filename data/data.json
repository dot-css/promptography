He is dressed in a tailored matte-black suit with a crisp white shirt, top button undone. His left hand is casually tucked into his pocket, while his right hand holds a lit cigarette, smoke curling upward in fine wisps that glow faintly in the dim streetlight.\n\n\n\nAround him, the street is alive with chaos: motion-blurred crowds of people running in different directions, headlights of cars streaking into glowing trails, reflections shimmering on wet asphalt. The man remains perfectly still and sharply focused, a stark contrast to the urgency of the background.\n\n\n\nLighting is gloomy and cinematic, with dramatic contrast—subtle film grain texture, deep shadows, and soft highlights evoking the look of vintage 35mm film. Shallow depth of field isolates the subject in crisp clarity while the environment dissolves into artistic blur. Fine details include raindrops on the car’s polished surface, glowing cigarette ember, and faint neon reflections from nearby storefronts.\n\n\n\nShot composition emphasizes mood and atmosphere: symmetrical overhead framing, 9:16 aspect ratio for vertical cinematic format, 8K resolution, hyper-real textures, and atmospheric realism worthy of a movie poster.",
